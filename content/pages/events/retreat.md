- **Midday Nourishment**:  break bread together in the mystical village of **Dolní Žleb**. 🥖✨

**A Note on the Ride**: This retreat offers some easy, blissful riding on premium Czech trails 🏞️🚵‍♂️, but if you're feeling some other riding, why not make your own path? Whether it's road or gravel, the trail is yours to create. Just meet us at the wellness ceremony and reconnect with the group for the evening's sacred fire and hot tub gathering. 🌅🔥

What will the trail teach you this time? 🌲✨
